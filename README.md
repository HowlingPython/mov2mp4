# mov2mp4

Lightweight desktop tool for batch-converting MOV files to MP4 using Python, Tkinter and ffmpeg.

The original use case was converting iPhone-recorded oscillation videos for frame-by-frame analysis in a physics experiment. The project is now organized as a proper Python package with a reusable conversion core, a GUI entry point, a CLI entry point, tests and `uv`-based project management.

## Features

* Batch conversion of multiple `.mov` files.
* Dynamic GUI built with Tkinter.
* Runtime font-size control in the main window.
* Permanent help bar for CRF and preset settings.
* CLI entry point for terminal-based conversion.
* Multithreaded conversion using `ThreadPoolExecutor`.
* Clean cancellation of active conversions.
* Configurable CRF, preset, ffmpeg binary, thread count and batch size.
* Rotating log written to `~/.mov2mp4_converter.log`.
* Standalone executable support through PyInstaller.

## Requirements

The project requires Python `>=3.10`, `uv`, and `ffmpeg` available in `PATH`.

`ffmpeg` is a system dependency, not a Python dependency. The project calls the `ffmpeg` executable through `subprocess`, so it must be installed separately unless `FFMPEG_BIN` is set in `.env`.

Check that `ffmpeg` is installed:

```bash
ffmpeg -version
```

On Ubuntu or Debian:

```bash
sudo apt install ffmpeg python3-tk
```

On macOS, using Homebrew:

```bash
brew install ffmpeg
```

On Windows, install ffmpeg and make sure the executable is available from PowerShell or CMD.

## Installation

From the repository root:

```bash
uv sync --extra dev
```

This creates or updates `.venv`, installs runtime dependencies and installs development dependencies such as `pytest` and `pyinstaller`.

After the first successful sync, `uv` generates `uv.lock`. Commit that file to keep dependency resolution reproducible across machines.

You do not need to activate the virtual environment. Use `uv run`.

## Usage

Open the GUI:

```bash
uv run mov2mp4-gui
```

Convert files from the command line:

```bash
uv run mov2mp4 video1.mov video2.mov -o output/
```

Set quality options from the CLI:

```bash
uv run mov2mp4 video.mov -o output/ --crf 18 --preset medium
```

Lower CRF means higher quality and larger files. Valid CRF values are from `0` to `51`.

## GUI workflow

1. Run `uv run mov2mp4-gui`.
2. Click `Seleccionar y convertir`.
3. Select one or more `.mov` files.
4. Select an output folder.
5. Wait for the progress bar or press `Cancelar` to stop cleanly.

Cancellation kills active `ffmpeg` processes and removes incomplete output files.

## GUI layout behavior

The GUI is dynamically sized from the current screen. In normal window mode, it starts at approximately `20%` of the available screen area, centered on screen.

The window is resizable. Buttons, progress bar, status text and the bottom help bar expand with the window. Status and help text wrap dynamically, so longer messages remain readable instead of being cut off.

The bottom of the main window contains a font-size control. Use the spinbox or the `+` and `−` buttons to change the GUI text size while the app is running. The default value comes from `DEFAULT_FONT_SIZE`.

The quality settings window is also dynamic. It scales from the current screen and supports horizontal resizing. The CRF and preset explanation stays in the main help bar instead of changing on hover.

## Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the project root to override defaults:

```env
FFMPEG_BIN=ffmpeg
FFMPEG_THREADS=2
BATCH_SIZE=
DEFAULT_CRF=18
DEFAULT_PRESET=medium
DEFAULT_FONT_SIZE=15
```

`FFMPEG_BIN` can be used to point directly to an ffmpeg executable when it is not available globally in `PATH`.

`FFMPEG_THREADS` controls how many threads each ffmpeg process may use.

`BATCH_SIZE` controls how many conversions run at the same time. If it is empty, the project chooses a conservative value from the CPU count and `FFMPEG_THREADS`.

`DEFAULT_CRF` controls video quality. Lower values produce higher quality and larger files.

`DEFAULT_PRESET` controls encoding speed versus compression efficiency.

`DEFAULT_FONT_SIZE` controls the default text size in the app. The GUI clamps it to a readable range and can also scale it upward on high-resolution screens.

## Tests

Run:

```bash
uv run pytest -q
```

The tests do not require real MOV files or ffmpeg execution. They validate command construction, configuration parsing and cancellation behavior.

## Building a standalone executable

Build the GUI with PyInstaller:

```bash
uv run pyinstaller mov2mp4_gui.spec
```

The executable is written to `dist/`.

The spec file uses `scripts/mov2mp4_gui.py` as a small launcher and includes `src/` in `pathex`, so PyInstaller can find the package.

The generated executable still requires ffmpeg to be available on the target machine unless the build is modified to bundle an ffmpeg binary explicitly.

## Project layout

```

`converter.py` contains the conversion logic and knows how to build and run `ffmpeg` commands.

`gui.py` contains the Tkinter UI logic, including the dynamic layout, runtime font-size control, static help bar and thread-safe queue polling.

`cli.py` exposes the command-line interface.

`config.py` loads environment-based settings.

`logging_config.py` configures the rotating log.

`opener.py` contains platform-specific output-folder opening logic.

## Notes on the threading model

Tkinter is not thread-safe. The GUI starts conversion in a background thread and receives progress messages through `queue.Queue`.

The UI polls the queue with `after()`, so worker threads never mutate widgets directly. This keeps the interface responsive while conversions are running.

## Git hygiene

The repository should not track generated files, local environments or converted videos.

The `.gitignore` should exclude at least:

```text
__pycache__/
*.pyc
.pytest_cache/
.venv/
*.egg-info/
build/
dist/
*.mov
*.mp4
*.log
.env
```

Do not ignore `uv.lock`. It should be committed.
